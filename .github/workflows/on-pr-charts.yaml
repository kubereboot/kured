#This is just extra testing, for lint check, and basic installation
#Those can fail earlier than functional tests (shorter tests)

  # We create two jobs (with a matrix) instead of one to make those parallel.
  # We don't need to conditionally check if something has changed, due to github actions
  # tackling that for us.
  # Fail-fast ensures that if one of those matrix job fail, the other one gets cancelled.
