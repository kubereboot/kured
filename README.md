## Introduction

Kured (KUbernetes REboot Daemon) is a Kubernetes daemonset that
performs safe automatic node reboots when the need to do so is
indicated by the package management system of the underlying OS.

* Watches for the presence of a reboot sentinel e.g. `/var/run/reboot-required`
* Utilises a lock in the API server to ensure only one node reboots at
  a time
* Optionally defers reboots in the presence of active Prometheus alerts or selected pods
* Cordons & drains worker nodes before reboot, uncordoning them after

## Kubernetes & OS Compatibility

The daemon image contains versions of `k8s.io/client-go` and the
`kubectl` binary for the purposes of maintaining the lock and draining
worker nodes. Kubernetes aims to provide forwards & backwards
compatibility of one minor version between client and server:

| kured  | kubectl | k8s.io/client-go | k8s.io/apimachinery | expected kubernetes compatibility |
|--------|---------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| master | 1.18.8  | v0.18.8          | v0.18.8             | 1.17.x, 1.18.x, 1.19.x            |
| 1.5.0  | 1.18.8  | v0.18.8          | v0.18.8             | 1.17.x, 1.18.x, 1.19.x            |
| 1.4.4  | 1.17.7  | v0.17.0          | v0.17.0             | 1.16.x, 1.17.x, 1.18.x            |
| 1.3.0  | 1.15.10 | v12.0.0          | release-1.15        | 1.15.x, 1.16.x, 1.17.x            |
| 1.2.0  | 1.13.6  | v10.0.0          | release-1.13        | 1.12.x, 1.13.x, 1.14.x            |
| 1.1.0  | 1.12.1  | v9.0.0           | release-1.12        | 1.11.x, 1.12.x, 1.13.x            |
| 1.0.0  | 1.7.6   | v4.0.0           | release-1.7         | 1.6.x, 1.7.x, 1.8.x               |

See the [release notes](https://github.com/weaveworks/kured/releases)
for specific version compatibility information, including which
combination have been formally tested.

Versions >=1.1.0 enter the host mount namespace to invoke
`systemctl reboot`, so should work on any systemd distribution.

## Installation

To obtain a default installation without Prometheus alerting interlock
or Slack notifications:

```console
latest=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/weaveworks/kured/releases | jq -r .[0].tag_name)
kubectl apply -f "https://github.com/weaveworks/kured/releases/download/$latest/kured-$latest-dockerhub.yaml"
```

If you want to customise the installation, download the manifest and
edit it in accordance with the following section before application.

## Configuration

The following arguments can be passed to kured via the daemonset pod template:

```console
Flags:
      --annotation-ttl time                  force clean annotation after this ammount of time (default 0, disabled)
      --alert-filter-regexp regexp.Regexp   alert names to ignore when checking for active alerts
      --blocking-pod-selector stringArray   label selector identifying pods whose presence should prevent reboots
      --command string                      systemctl command to run when sentinel is found (default "reboot")
      --ds-name string                      name of daemonset on which to place lock (default "kured")
      --ds-namespace string                 namespace containing daemonset on which to place lock (default "kube-system")
      --end-time string                     only reboot before this time of day (default "23:59")
  -h, --help                                help for kured
      --lock-annotation string              annotation in which to record locking node (default "weave.works/kured-node-lock")
      --period duration                     reboot check period (default 1h0m0s)
      --prometheus-url string               Prometheus instance to probe for active alerts
      --reboot-days strings                 only reboot on these days (default [su,mo,tu,we,th,fr,sa])
      --reboot-sentinel string              path to file whose existence signals need to reboot (default "/var/run/reboot-required")
      --slack-channel string                slack channel for reboot notfications
      --slack-hook-url string               slack hook URL for reboot notfications
      --slack-username string               slack username for reboot notfications (default "kured")
      --start-time string                   only reboot after this time of day (default "0:00")
      --time-zone string                    use this timezone to calculate allowed reboot time (default "UTC")
```

### Reboot Sentinel File & Period

By default kured checks for the existence of
`/var/run/reboot-required` every sixty minutes; you can override these
values with `--reboot-sentinel` and `--period`. Each replica of the
daemon uses a random offset derived from the period on startup so that
nodes don't all contend for the lock simultaneously.

### Setting a schedule

By default, kured will reboot any time it detects the sentinel, but this
may cause reboots during odd hours.  While service disruption does not
normally occur, anything is possible and operators may want to restrict
reboots to predictable schedules.  Use `--reboot-days`, `--start-time`,
`--end-time`, and `--time-zone` to set a schedule.  For example, business
hours on the west coast USA can be specified with:

```console
  --reboot-days mon,tue,wed,thu,fri
  --start-time 9am
  --end-time 5pm
  --time-zone America/Los_Angeles
```

Times can be formatted in numerous ways, including `5pm`, `5:00pm` `17:00`,
and `17`.  `--time-zone` represents a Go `time.Location`, and can be `UTC`,
`Local`, or any entry in the standard Linux tz database.

Note that when using smaller time windows, you should consider shortening
the sentinel check period (`--period`).

### Blocking Reboots via Alerts

You may find it desirable to block automatic node reboots when there
are active alerts - you can do so by providing the URL of your
Prometheus server:

```console
--prometheus-url=http://prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local
```

By default the presence of *any* active (pending or firing) alerts
will block reboots, however you can ignore specific alerts:

```console
--alert-filter-regexp=^(RebootRequired|AnotherBenignAlert|...$
```

See the section on Prometheus metrics for an important application of this
filter.

### Blocking Reboots via Pods

You can also block reboots of an _individual node_ when specific pods
are scheduled on it:

```console
--blocking-pod-selector=runtime=long,cost=expensive
```

Since label selector strings use commas to express logical 'and', you can
specify this parameter multiple times for 'or':

```console
--blocking-pod-selector=runtime=long,cost=expensive
--blocking-pod-selector=name=temperamental
```

In this case, the presence of either an (appropriately labelled) expensive long
running job or a known temperamental pod on a node will stop it rebooting.

> Try not to abuse this mechanism - it's better to strive for
> restartability where possible. If you do use it, make sure you set
> up a RebootRequired alert as described in the next section so that
> you can intervene manually if reboots are blocked for too long.

### Prometheus Metrics

Each kured pod exposes a single gauge metric (`:8080/metrics`) that
indicates the presence of the sentinel file:

```console
# HELP kured_reboot_required OS requires reboot due to software updates.
# TYPE kured_reboot_required gauge
kured_reboot_required{node="ip-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ec2.internal"} 0
```

The purpose of this metric is to power an alert which will summon an
operator if the cluster cannot reboot itself automatically for a
prolonged period:

```console
# Alert if a reboot is required for any machines. Acts as a failsafe for the
# reboot daemon, which will not reboot nodes if there are pending alerts save
# this one.
ALERT RebootRequired
  IF          max(kured_reboot_required) != 0
  FOR         24h
  LABELS      { severity="warning" }
  ANNOTATIONS {
    summary = "Machine(s) require being rebooted, and the reboot daemon has failed to do so for 24 hours",
    impact = "Cluster nodes more vulnerable to security exploits. Eventually, no disk space left.",
    description = "Machine(s) require being rebooted, probably due to kernel update.",
  }
```

If you choose to employ such an alert and have configured kured to
probe for active alerts before rebooting, be sure to specify
`--alert-filter-regexp=^RebootRequired$` to avoid deadlock!

### Slack Notifications

If you specify a Slack hook via `--slack-hook-url`, kured will notify
you immediately prior to rebooting a node:

![Notification](img/slack-notification.png)

We recommend setting `--slack-username` to be the name of the
environment, e.g. `dev` or `prod`.

### Overriding Lock Configuration

The `--ds-name` and `--ds-namespace` arguments should match the name and
namespace of the daemonset used to deploy the reboot daemon - the locking is
implemented by means of an annotation on this resource. The defaults match
the daemonset YAML provided in the repository.

Similarly `--lock-annotation` can be used to change the name of the
annotation kured will use to store the lock, but the default is almost
certainly safe.

## Operation

The example commands in this section assume that you have not
overriden the default lock annotation, daemonset name or namespace;
if you have, you will have to adjust the commands accordingly.

### Testing

You can test your configuration by provoking a reboot on a node:

```console
sudo touch /var/run/reboot-required
```

### Disabling Reboots

If you need to temporarily stop kured from rebooting any nodes, you
can take the lock manually:

```console
kubectl -n kube-system annotate ds kured weave.works/kured-node-lock='{"nodeID":"manual"}'
```

Don't forget to release it afterwards!

### Manual Unlock

In exceptional circumstances, such as a node experiencing a permanent
failure whilst rebooting, manual intervention may be required to
remove the cluster lock:

```console
kubectl -n kube-system annotate ds kured weave.works/kured-node-lock-
```

> NB the `-` at the end of the command is important - it instructs
> `kubectl` to remove that annotation entirely.

### Automatic Unlock

In exceptional circumstances (especially when used with cluster-autoscaler) a node
which holds lock might be killed thus annotation will stay there for ever.

Using `--annotation-ttl=30m` will allow other nodes to take over if TTL has expired (in this case 30min) and continue reboot process.

## Building

See the [CircleCI config](.circleci/config.yml) for the preferred
version of Golang. Kured now uses [Go
Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules), so build
instructions vary depending on where you have checked out the
repository:

**Building outside $GOPATH:**

```console
make
```

**Building inside $GOPATH:**

```console
GO111MODULE=on make
```

If you are interested in contributing code to kured, please take a look at
our [development][development] docs.

## Frequently Asked/Anticipated Questions

### Why is there no `latest` tag on Docker Hub?

Use of `latest` for production deployments is bad practice - see
[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview) for
details. The manifest on `master` refers to `latest` for local
development testing with minikube only; for production use choose a
versioned manifest from the [release page](https://github.com/weaveworks/kured/releases/).
